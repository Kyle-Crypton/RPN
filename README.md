#Reverse Polish Notation


##Introduction
***
Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands, in contrast to Polish Notation (PN), which put the operator before its operands. It is also known as postfix notation and does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. The description "Polish" refers to the nationality of logician Jan ≈Åukasiewicz, who invented (prefix) Polish notation in the 1920s.

##Examples

```
Enter the RPN, end with '#': 3 4 5 + * #
The result is:27
Enter the RPN, end with '#': 3 4 5 * + #
The result is:23
```

##Usage
